Start creating a new prompt template with one click. Editing existing templates is just as easy.\n\n[b]🧠 Xano integration for large GPT-4 prompts[/b]\nIf an API request takes longer than 60 seconds to respond, Bubble will return an error. This is an issue with the GPT-4 API as large prompts will take longer than that. Casper is the only AI SaaS template to come with a Xano integration and implementation docs to help you get around this. Create a free Xano account and follow our guide for a painless setup.\n\n[b]📝 Flexible and beautiful document editor[/b]\nCasper's document editor is powered by tiptap.js. We tested every rich text editor bubble plugin available (including the paid ones) and Tiptap is by far the most flexible and capable. Oh, and Casper's document editor is responsive. Jasper's isn't. Yikes!\n\n[b]💳 Stripe Integration[/b]\nStart selling access to your platform faster with Casper's complete Stripe integration. Be up and running in less than 10 minutes by following our documentation video.\n\n[b]🎁 Bonus credits consumption logic[/b]\nCasper is the only Bubble template in it's category with bonus credits. You can use these to run promotions, reward users for referrals, and more. Note that monthly \"plan credits\" are consumed first, and then bonus credits after. Once a user uses all of their credits, they won't be able to generate responses anymore.\n\n[b]🎨 Clean UI for easy rebranding[/b]\nCasper uses bubble style variables to make rebranding a breeze. \n\nTest Casper out with our functional demo app: https://openai-saas-platform.bubbleapps.io/version-test\n\nThis template requires access to backend workflows which are only available on paid plans. \n\nCasper is sold as-is and includes lifetime support of core features. For support inquiries, please submit a support ticket via our help center at https://casper.noblemen.com. Our average response time is 1-2 business days.\n\nIf you're looking for hands-on assistance beyond core template support, we offer paid coaching sessions to work through roadblocks, build features, and answer any questions you have about building in Bubble.
